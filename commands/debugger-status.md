Display the current state of the debugging memory system:

```bash
npx @tyroneross/claude-code-debugger status
```

This shows:
- Number of stored incidents
- Number of extracted patterns
- Storage size
- Recent activity

Use this to understand what debugging knowledge has been accumulated and whether the memory system is working correctly.
