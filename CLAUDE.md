## Debugging Memory

This project uses @tyroneross/claude-code-debugger for debugging memory.

**Automatic behavior:**
- Past debugging sessions are stored and indexed
- Similar incidents surface automatically when investigating bugs
- Patterns are extracted from repeated issues

**Manual commands:**
- `/memory-debug "symptom"` - Search memory before debugging
- `/memory-status` - Show memory statistics
- `/memory-mine` - Mine recent audit trail

The system learns from your debugging sessions automatically.
