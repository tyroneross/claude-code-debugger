A debugging memory system for Claude Code that automatically learns from past incidents and suggests solutions based on similar problems you've already solved.

## Features

- **Incident Tracking**: Store complete debugging incidents with symptoms, root causes, fixes, and verification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically detect recurring problems and extract reusable patterns
- **Smart Retrieval**: Find similar incidents using keyword-based similarity matching
- **Audit Trail Mining**: Recover incidents from `.claude/audit` files when manual storage is missed
- **Dual Storage Modes**:
  - **Local mode**: Each project has its own `.claude/memory/`
  - **Shared mode**: All projects share `~/.claude-memory/` for cross-project learning
- **CLI Access**: Command-line interface for quick memory operations
- **Programmatic API**: Import and use in your TypeScript/JavaScript code

## Installation

### Local Installation (Recommended)

Clone and install in your project:

```bash
# Clone into your project's .claude directory
git clone https://github.com/tyroneross/claude-code-debugger .claude/memory
cd .claude/memory
npm install
npm run build
```

### Global Installation

Install globally via GitHub:

```bash
npm install -g github:tyroneross/claude-code-debugger
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude-memory --version
claude-memory status
```

## Why Not on NPM?

This is a personal tool optimized for my workflow with Claude Code.
Publishing to NPM would require:
- Generic configuration (would lose opinionated defaults I rely on)
- Support burden (it's designed for power users)
- Authentication complexity (currently uses local filesystem)

For now, it's designed for developers comfortable with GitHub
installation. If there's demand, I may publish a more configurable
version.

**Want to use it?** Clone it, try it for a week, modify it for
your workflow. That's the point.

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Check current configuration
claude-memory config

# Show memory statistics
claude-memory status

# Search memory before debugging
claude-memory debug "Search filters not working"

# Search for specific incidents
claude-memory search "react hooks"

# Suggest patterns to extract
claude-memory patterns

# Extract and store patterns
claude-memory patterns --extract

# Mine audit trail for missed incidents
claude-memory mine --days 30

# Store mined incidents
claude-memory mine --days 30 --store
```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import {
  debugWithMemory,
  storeDebugIncident,
  checkMemory,
  extractPatterns,
  mineAuditTrail
} from '@tyroneross/claude-memory';

// Before debugging: Check for similar incidents
const result = await debugWithMemory("Search filters not working", {
  min_confidence: 0.7
});

console.log('Session ID:', result.context_used.session_id);

// After fixing: Store the incident
await storeDebugIncident(sessionId, {
  root_cause: {
    description: "Missing useMemo dependency caused infinite re-renders",
    category: "react-hooks",
    confidence: 0.9
  },
  fix: {
    approach: "Added missing dependency to useMemo array",
    changes: ["components/SearchBar.tsx"],
    time_to_fix: 15
  },
  verification: {
    status: 'verified',
    regression_tests_passed: true,
    user_journey_tested: true,
    success_criteria_met: true
  }
});

// Search memory directly
const memory = await checkMemory("infinite render loop", {
  similarity_threshold: 0.5,
  max_results: 5
});

// Extract patterns from incidents
const patterns = await extractPatterns({
  min_incidents: 3,
  min_similarity: 0.7,
  auto_store: true
});

// Mine audit trail
const incidents = await mineAuditTrail({
  days_back: 30,
  auto_store: true,
  min_confidence: 0.7
});
```

## Configuration

### Storage Modes

**Local Mode (default)**
- Each project has its own `.claude/memory/` directory
- Incidents and patterns are project-specific
- Best for: Project-specific debugging context

**Shared Mode**
- All projects share `~/.claude-memory/` globally
- Learn across all your projects
- Best for: Common patterns that appear in multiple projects

### Switch Modes

```bash
# Use shared mode for this command
claude-memory status --shared

# Set shared mode via environment variable
export CLAUDE_MEMORY_MODE=shared
claude-memory status

# In code
import { getConfig } from '@tyroneross/claude-memory';

const config = getConfig({
  storageMode: 'shared'
});
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Storage mode: 'local' or 'shared'
CLAUDE_MEMORY_MODE=shared

# Custom memory path (overrides mode defaults)
CLAUDE_MEMORY_PATH=/custom/path/to/memory
```

## How It Works

### 1. Incident Structure

Each incident captures:
- **Symptom**: What the bug looked like
- **Root Cause**: Why it happened (with confidence score)
- **Fix**: How it was resolved (approach + file changes)
- **Verification**: Testing status
- **Quality Gates**: Security and review status
- **Tags**: For categorization and search

### 2. Pattern Extraction

When 3+ similar incidents are detected:
- Automatically extract common characteristics
- Create reusable pattern with solution template
- Track success rate and usage history
- Include caveats for edge cases

### 3. Retrieval Strategy

**Pattern-First Approach:**
1. Try to match against known patterns (90% confidence)
2. If no pattern matches, search incidents (70% confidence)
3. Use keyword-based Jaccard similarity
4. Prefer recent incidents (90-day window)

### 4. Audit Trail Mining

Recover incidents from `.claude/audit/` files:
- Parses root cause analysis documents
- Extracts error tracking logs
- Converts fix reports into incidents
- Filters duplicates and low-confidence entries

## Real-World Usage

**Personal Stats (3 months):**
- 47 incidents stored
- 12 patterns extracted
- Average debug time: 15 min (down from 45 min for recurring issues)
- Most common patterns: React hooks, API timeouts, infinite renders

**Example: Recurring React Hook Bug**

Before using this tool:
- Hit infinite render bug in SearchBar component
- Spent 45 minutes debugging
- Fixed it

Two weeks later:
- Hit similar bug in DashboardFilters
- Ran: `claude-memory debug "infinite render loop"`
- Tool suggested: "Missing useMemo dependency (similar to SearchBar incident)"
- Fixed in 15 minutes

**This is why I built it.**

## Technical Deep Dive

### Pattern Extraction Algorithm

The core innovation is detecting when 3+ similar incidents can
become a reusable pattern:

1. **Categorization:** Group incidents by root cause category
2. **Similarity Scoring:** Calculate Jaccard similarity on tags/files
3. **Threshold Filtering:** Extract patterns at 70%+ similarity
4. **Pattern Storage:** Store with success rate and usage history

See `src/pattern-extractor.ts` for implementation.

### Storage Architecture

**Local Mode (default):**
- Each project: `.claude/memory/`
- Incidents/patterns stay project-specific

**Shared Mode:**
- All projects: `~/.claude-memory/`
- Learn patterns across all your work

### Retrieval Strategy

When you search memory:
1. Try pattern matching first (90% confidence threshold)
2. Fall back to incident search (70% confidence threshold)
3. Use temporal preference (favor recent incidents within 90 days)
4. Return best match with session context

### Why This Approach?

Most debugging tools focus on logs/traces. This focuses on
**human knowledge capture** - the "aha" moments when you finally
understand root cause.

It's optimized for: "I've solved this before, what did I do?"

```

## Integration with Claude Code

### Prompt for Agents

Include in your agent prompts:

```markdown
Before debugging, check memory:
- Run: `npx claude-memory debug "symptom description"`
- Review similar incidents and patterns
- Apply known solutions if confidence is high

After fixing:
- Store incident with: `npx claude-memory store`
- Or use programmatic API from TypeScript
```

### Automated Mining

Set up periodic audit mining:

```bash
# Weekly cron job to mine audit trail
0 0 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && npx claude-memory mine --days 7 --store
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Before Debugging
```bash
claude-memory debug "symptom" --threshold 0.7
```

### 2. Store Complete Incidents
Include all fields for maximum reuse:
- Root cause with confidence score
- Complete fix description
- Verification status
- Quality gates

### 3. Extract Patterns Regularly
```bash
# Weekly pattern extraction
claude-memory patterns --extract
```

### 4. Mine Audit Trail
```bash
# Monthly audit mining
claude-memory mine --days 30 --store
```

### 5. Use Shared Mode for Common Issues
```bash
export CLAUDE_MEMORY_MODE=shared
```
